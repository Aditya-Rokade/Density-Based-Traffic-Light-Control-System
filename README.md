# Density-Based Dynamic Traffic Signal System

Welcome to our innovative traffic management project aimed at revolutionizing urban commute experiences! This repository houses the intelligent framework designed to dynamically adjust traffic signal timings based on real-time traffic density.

## Files:

### 1. Image Detection (image_detection.py)
This file contains the Python script responsible for detecting traffic density using cameras placed along roadways. It processes images to gather crucial data for signal adjustments.

### 2. Video Processing (video_processing.py)
Here lies the Python script handling video processing tasks. It provides an interface to test and analyze traffic flow using sample videos from the 'videos' folder.

### 3. Model File (model.pt)
The 'model.pt' file stores the trained model used in traffic density calculations. This model aids in accurate prediction and decision-making within the system.

### 4. Arduino Code (arduino_led_code.ino)
This file holds the Arduino code responsible for controlling the LEDs of the traffic signals. It interfaces with the decision-making system to implement real-time signal adjustments.

## Additional Folder:

### Videos
The 'videos' folder contains sample traffic videos. These videos serve as test cases to evaluate the functionality and efficiency of the system.

# Happy optimizing city commutes with intelligence-driven traffic signals!
